# WebSocket mMbile Controler

Exercise with socket.io connection - controling things on desktop with mobile device.  

Kinda like a second screen. Idea was to make steering wheel out of users mobile device, by controling movement on large screen by tilting mobile device. 


## Installation and usage
run 
```
npm install
``` 
and afterwards 
```
node index
```

* Open localhost:3000 on your desktop
* Navigate to that page on mobile device (via desktops ip address)
* Tilt/pitch/skew mobile device, and you should see grey rectangle moving on desktop according to your device movement
